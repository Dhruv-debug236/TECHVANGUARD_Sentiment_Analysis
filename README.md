Sentiment Analysis Project: Description<br>
Overview<br>
This project is a terminal-based sentiment analysis tool that uses Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, and TextBlob. It allows users to input text directly and provides instant feedback on the sentiment, identifying it as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.<br>
<br>
Features<br>
Direct User Input:<br>
Users type text directly into the terminal for analysis.<br>
Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob:<br>
Leverages the simplicity of TextBlob for sentiment classification.<br>
Visualization:<br>
Displays sentiment analysis results using Matplotlib for graphical representation.<br>
Data Handling:<br>
Uses Pandas and NumPy for managing and processing data efficiently.<br>
How It Works<br>
Input:<br>
The user enters text directly in the terminal.<br>
Processing:<br>
TextBlob analyzes the text to determine polarity and classifies it as positive, negative, or neutral.<br>
Output:<br>
The sentiment is displayed in the terminal, and results can be visualized with charts like bar graphs or pie charts using Matplotlib.<br>
Applications<br>
Learning Tool: Ideal for understanding basic sentiment analysis and visualization.<br>
Quick Sentiment Checks: Analyze and visualize sentiment directly without complex setups.
<br>
Tools and Libraries Used:
<br>
Matplotlib | Pandas | Numpy | Textblob
<br>
<br>
Data source : Kaggle 
<br>
<br>
Execution Steps
<br>
Step 1: Go to the folder Data and download the csv file
<br>
Step 2: Copy the path of the file and paste the file path where mention in the code. For example if the file path is C:/Users/dp439_ykr3dmm/OneDrive/Desktop/ then write the file name at the end with .csv.
<br>
Step 3: If the code does not work then put r before the double quotes inside the parenthesis where you have mention the file path.
<br>
Step 4: Run the code.
<br>
You have successfully run the code.

<br>
Summary of Results:
<br>
Sentiment Distribution:
<br>
Positive Sentiment: Dominates the dataset (79%), indicating that most texts express favorable emotions or attitudes.
<br>
Negative Sentiment: Accounts for 21%, showing a smaller but significant proportion of dissatisfaction or criticism.
<br>
Neutral Sentiment: None detected in the sample, suggesting the analyzed texts are emotionally charged rather than neutral.
<br>
Polarity Insights:
<br>
Average Polarity Score: +0.12, indicating a slight overall lean towards positive sentiment in the analyzed text.
<br>
Observations:
<br>
The high proportion of positive sentiment reflects general satisfaction or optimistic views within the sample.
<br>
The presence of 21% negative sentiment suggests specific areas of concern or dissatisfaction that may need attention.
<br>
Neutral sentiment is absent, indicating that most input texts have discernible emotional tones.

<br>
Challenges Faced
<br>
Finding the Right Dataset
<br>
The first challenge was to find a dataset with proper labels and text for sentiment analysis. After searching, I found a suitable dataset on Kaggle.
<br>
Dataset Size
<br>
The dataset from Kaggle was too large for the project. To make it manageable, I shortened it by selecting a smaller but balanced portion of the data.
<br>
Fixing Errors
<br>
I faced many errors while working on the project.
<br>
Solution: To fix these errors, I used help from ChatGPT, YouTube tutorials, and other online resources.
